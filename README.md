# Genetic-Algorithms
It is an experimental implementation of GA

Many thanks to Burak Kanber (https://www.burakkanber.com/blog/machine-learning-genetic-algorithms-part-1-javascript/) for sharing his code. We just extended it a little.

Define a target at the index! It will reach it using crossover and mutation of ga.

If you need to specify parameters for some real opt problem. Just set them as different parameters and define a related cost function (fitfunction).
